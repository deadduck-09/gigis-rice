## 🖥 Full System Installation (Optional)

Starting with a fresh Arch Linux installation?

A complete plug-and-play installer is also available. It installs the required packages, configures services, deploys the rice, and prepares the system so you can start using it immediately.

Run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deadduck-09/gigis-rice/main/fullsetup-install.sh | bash
```

### What it does

- 📦 Installs all required packages
- 🧩 Installs AUR dependencies
- ⚙️ Enables required services
- 🖼 Installs wallpapers
- 🚀 Provides a ready-to-use desktop after installation

> [!TIP]
> This installer is intended for **fresh Arch Linux installations**. If you already have Niri and Noctalia set up, the standard `install.sh` installer above is the recommended option.
